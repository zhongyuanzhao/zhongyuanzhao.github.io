Abstract
===
In a method for mitigating the vibration-induced phase noise of an phase locked loop with an acceleration sensitive voltage controlled oscillator, a correction signal generated by applying a gain and a equalization to an acceleration signal provided by an acceleration sensor sensing the acceleration on the VCO, is added to the oscillator control signal for active compensation, an adaptive compensation unit dynamically adjusts the gain, the frequency response of equalization, and the sensing direction of the acceleration sensor while the phase locked loop is working to make the active compensation automatically adapt to the parameters of the voltage controlled oscillator.
