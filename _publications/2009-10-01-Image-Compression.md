Abstract
===
A real-time image compression system based on JPEG2000 image compression standard will be presented for high resolution CCD camera. This paper will give the scheme of real-time high resolution image compression formed by image segmentation and parallel compression using multiple ADV212s. The test results show that this resolution is feasible and effective for the given processing system.
