## About
This thesis is about design and implementation of a soft starter for 3-phase AC motor to reduce the electrical and mechanical impacts during its starting. The soft starter is a close-loop PID controller implemented on TI TMS320F2800 Digital Signal Controller, CPLD is used to generate PWM waveforms driving SCR/IGBT power bridge. It is awarded as Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis in 2006 by UESTC.
