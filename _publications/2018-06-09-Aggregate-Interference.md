Abstract
===
Interference management in current TV white space and Citizens Broadband Radio Service networks is mainly based on geographical separation of primary and secondary users. This approach overprotects primary users at the cost of available spectrum for secondary users. Potential solutions include acquiring more primary user information, such as a measurement-enhanced geographical database, and cooperative primary user, such as the TV set feedback in the next generation TV systems. However, one challenge of these solutions is to effectively manage the aggregate interference at TV receivers from interweaving secondary users. In this paper, a stochastic geometry-based aggregate interference model is developed for unlicensed spectrum shared by heterogeneous secondary users that have various transmit powers and multi-antenna capabilities. Moreover, an efficient computation approach is presented to capture network dynamics in real-time via a down-sampling that preserves high-quantile precision of the model. The stochastic geometry-based model is verified experimentally in ISM band. It is shown that the model enables separate control of admission and transmit power of multiple co-located secondary networks to protect primary users and maximize spectrum utilization.
