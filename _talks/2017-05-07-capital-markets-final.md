This essay covers many aspects of high frequency trading. In one section of this essay, I analyzed the mechanism of some high frequency trading strategies, such as front-running, from technical perspective of existing Internet infrastructure, e.g. how an order travels from the trading desk through the Internet to multiple geographically distributed stock exchanges. Based on those analysis, I provided some suggestions on how large financial institutions could avoid being the victim of front-runners.
