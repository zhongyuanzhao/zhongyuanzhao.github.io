[Curriculum Vitae]({{site.baseurl}}/files/zhongyuanzhao-cv-2018.pdf)

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University. I work with [Prof. Santiago Segarra](http://segarra.rice.edu/) on topics of using deep learning, especially graph neural networks and reinforcement learning, to improve the wireless networks.

I got my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2019, where I worked with [Dr. Mehmet C. Vuran](http://cse.unl.edu/~mcvuran/) on [dynamic spectrum sharing]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio/cognitive-radio-networks/). Before my Ph.D program, I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Electronic Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and worked in ArrayComm and Ericsson developing 4th generation wireless base-stations.
