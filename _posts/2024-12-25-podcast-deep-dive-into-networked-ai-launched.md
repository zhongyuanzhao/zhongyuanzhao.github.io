As the year draws to a close, I’m excited to announce the launch of my podcast, Deep Dive into Networked AI. This podcast is designed to help you navigate the cutting edge of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, optimization, signal processing, wireless communications, and networked systems, offering fresh ideas to fuel your research and understanding.

### Why This Podcast and What’s in It for You?

Research papers can be dense, technical, and time-consuming to digest. Keeping up with the rapidly evolving fields of artificial intelligence, wireless communications, and networked systems can feel overwhelming, especially with hundreds of thousands of new papers published each year. This podcast is here to ease that burden for those interested in Networked AI.

Each episode is generated using NotebookLM by Google under my careful oversight, focusing on either a single paper or multiple works around a specific topic. The goal is to distill the key ideas and provide a big-picture understanding of the research—all without the need to be glued to a screen. While the podcast helps convey high-level insights, diving into the technical details will still require reading the papers yourself.
