Since the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine war on Feb. 24, 2022, the high frequency (HF) radios have made into [headlines](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/business/media/bbc-shortwave-radio-ukraine.html) and sparked quite some [interests](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/radio-related-news-occurring-in-the-russia-ukraine-conflict/) in the amateur radio community. What makes MF (300KHz-3MHz) and HF (3-30MHz) radio extremely interesting is the [Ionospheric Radio Propagation](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/antennas-propagation/ionospheric/hf-propagation-basics.php), a.k.a. [skywave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave).

> "In radio communication, skywave or skip refers to the propagation of radio waves reflected or refracted back toward Earth from the ionosphere, an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere. Since it is not limited by the curvature of the Earth, skywave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the horizon, at intercontinental distances. It is mostly used in the shortwave frequency bands."

The ionosphere is greatly affected by the time of the day and the space weather, which subsequently influences the propagation of skywave. Therefore, users of AM broadcast services and Single Side Band (SSB) communications need to schedule their radio frequencies accordingly. Typically, lower frequencies at night and higher frequencies during the day. This is a very unique feature of HF radios.

Here are some educational materials for people interested in this topic

- Episode 9 - Lessons from the Field

_Note that episodes 7-9 in this series are missing for obvious reasons. I added some links which I think are useful. This is the best introductory lecture for HF radios I have seen so far._

## 3. WebSDR
Beginners and hobbyists can access to worldwide software-defined radio (SDR) websites (<http://websdr.org>) to get some first-hand experience of MF and HF radios for free. Here is the screenshot of the oldest webRF (<http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/>) provided by the amateur radio club at the University of Twente in Netherlands.
