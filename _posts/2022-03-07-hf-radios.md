Since the escalation of the [Russo-Ukrainian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) on Feb. 24, 2022, the high frequency (HF) radio has made [headlines](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/business/media/bbc-shortwave-radio-ukraine.html) and sparked some [discussions](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/radio-related-news-occurring-in-the-russia-ukraine-conflict/) in the amateur radio community. What makes MF (300KHz-3MHz) and HF (3-30MHz) radio extremely interesting is the [Ionospheric Radio Propagation](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/antennas-propagation/ionospheric/hf-propagation-basics.php), a.k.a. [skywave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave).

> "In radio communication, skywave or skip refers to the propagation of radio waves reflected or refracted back toward Earth from the ionosphere, an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere. Since it is not limited by the curvature of the Earth, skywave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the horizon, at intercontinental distances. It is mostly used in the shortwave frequency bands."

Specifically, there are two modes of skywave propagation, as illustrated in the following figures. Low incidence skywave can reach to longer distances, leaving a skip zone nearby. The skip zone can be covered by near vertical incidence skywave (NVIS). In theory, a 20 Watt handheld SSB HF radio can talk to receivers thousands of kilometers away through low incidence skywave, or receivers within a few hundreds of kilometers in NVIS mode.

The ionosphere is greatly affected by the time of the day and the space weather, which subsequently influence the workable frequency bands of skywave. Therefore, users of AM broadcast services and Single Side Band (SSB) communications in HF bands need to schedule their radio frequencies accordingly. Typically, lower frequencies at night and higher frequencies during the day. This is a very unique feature of HF radios.

_Note that episodes 7-9 in this series are missing for obvious reasons. I added some links which I think are useful. This is the best introductory lecture for HF radios I have seen so far._

## 3. WebSDR
Beginners and hobbyists can access to worldwide software-defined radio (SDR) websites (<http://websdr.org>) to get some first-hand experience of MF and HF radios for free. Here is the screenshot of the oldest webRF (<http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/>) provided by the amateur radio club at the University of Twente in Netherlands.

## 5. If you just wanna listen to radio stations...
Here are some jargons you need to know. 

AM/FM/LW/VHF/Shortwave SSB Radio

AM: Amplitute modulation
FM: Frequency modulation, usually refer to [FM broacasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting)
SSB: Single Side Band

LW: Longwave, or medium frequency (MF), 300KHz-3MHz
SW: Shortwave, or high frequency (HF), 3-30MHz
VHF radio: 30-299MHz
FM radio: 88.0-108.0 MHz
Airband/Aircraft band: 108-136 MHz, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airband>
