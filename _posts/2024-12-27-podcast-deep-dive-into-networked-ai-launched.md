As 2024 draws to a close, I’m excited to announce the launch of my podcast, Deep Dive into Networked AI. This podcast is designed to help you navigate the cutting edge of artificial intelligence (AI) and signal processing in networked systems, offering fresh ideas to fuel your research and understanding.

### Making Research More Accessible

Research papers are dense, technical, and time-consuming to digest.  It is a daunting task to keep up with the rapidly evolving fields of artificial intelligence, wireless communications, and networked systems, in which hundreds of thousands of new papers are published annually.  This podcast is here to ease that burden for those interested in the niche of Networked AI.

Each episode is generated using Google NotebookLM, drawing from either a single paper or multiple works around a specific topic—through several iterations of customization and manual validation. The goal is to help you distill  key ideas and grasp the big-picture of the research—all without the need to be glued to a screen.  While the podcast helps convey high-level insights, diving into the technical details will still require reading the papers yourself.

### Join the Journey

You can find the podcast on:

I’d love to hear your feedback and paper recommendations to make this show even more engaging and valuable.

Happy holidays, and enjoy the journey!
