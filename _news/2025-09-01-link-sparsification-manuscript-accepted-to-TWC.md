I’m excited to share that our paper, ["Distributed Link Sparsification for Scalable Scheduling using Graph Neural Networks"](/publications/2024-02-28-distributed-link-sparsification-for-scalable-scheduling-using-gcn.html), has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications. 

We train GNNs to guide links to withdraw from scheduling contention smartly, easing congestion while preserving network capacity. 

Preprint and code will be up soon — stay tuned!
