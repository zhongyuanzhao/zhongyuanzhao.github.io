### [Poster: Sparsity-enhanced Lagrangian Relaxation (SeLR) for Computation Offloading at the Edge](/publications/2025-10-30-poster-serl-for-edge-computing-mobihoc25.html)
*(Negar Erfaniantaghvayi, Zhongyuan Zhao, Kevin Chan, Ananthram Swami, Santiago Segarra)*  

We are delighted to share that our poster *“Sparsity-enhanced Lagrangian Relaxation (SeLR) for Computation Offloading at the Edge”* received the **Best Poster Award** at **ACM MobiHoc 2025**, held in Houston, TX.  
Congratulations to **Negar Erfaniantaghvayi**, who led this work and is about to defend her PhD — an outstanding achievement recognized by the MobiHoc community! 🎉  

This work introduces **SeLR**, a convex relaxation framework that combines **primal–dual optimization** with **reweighted ℓ₁-regularization** to tackle the NP-hard problem of **joint task offloading and routing** in edge networks.  
Compared to traditional greedy heuristics, SeLR **significantly reduces the optimality gap** while maintaining **comparable runtime**, offering a practical balance between scalability and near-optimality for real-time decision-making at the edge.

The poster version is available on ACM DL, and the extended paper can be found on arXiv.
