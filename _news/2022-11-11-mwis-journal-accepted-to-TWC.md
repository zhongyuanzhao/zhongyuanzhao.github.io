This work [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05536) has been accepted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications ([Early Access](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9962800)). The preprint arXiv will be updated in the next few days.

This manuscript extends our conference paper, “[Distributed Scheduling Using Graph Neural Networks](/posts/2021/06/mwis-presented-icassp-2021/)” published in IEEE ICASSP 2021, from multiple aspects, including more detailed description, new methods of centralized scheduling, structural variations of the distributed solution for better performance or complexity, as well as additional numerical results.
