This work generalizes biased backpressure routing and scheduling from exclusive commodity selection to  multi-commodity link sharing to mitigate starvation of bursty traffic (the last packet problem).
The [PrePrint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09902) includes improved theoretical proof over its earlier, more extended version on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21721).

The full version is under preparation for journal submission, which will include more theoretical and experimental results over the PrePrint.
