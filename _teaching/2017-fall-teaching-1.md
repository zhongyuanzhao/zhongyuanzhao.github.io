As the only graduate teaching assistant, I helped [Prof. Leen-Kiat Soh](https://cse.unl.edu/~lksoh/) in the interactive learning sessions (Game Days), in which over 20 students work in teams to learn strategies in different settings by interacting with other teams. My job was to setup an online website developed by previous TAs, and helped in preparing Game Day reports afterwards. 

Meanwhile, I also audited this course, which covers many interesting topics, such as game theory, distributed solutions, social choice, mechanism design, and auctions. See the [Syllabus](https://cse.unl.edu/~lksoh/Classes/CSCE475_875_Fall17/syllabus.pdf) from Prof. Soh's website.
