My dissertation is on [cognitive radio networks]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio/cognitive-radio-networks/) -- a family of technologies that enables next generation wireless networks to learn and adapt to its radio environment. My toolbox includes:
* Mathematical Models
* Machine Learning, Deep Learning
* High Performance Computing
* Wireless Experiments 

Specifically, I work on technical and business problems such as how wireless networks could share the radio spectrum more efficiently (dynamic spectrum access), how network operators could profit from stochastic resource and demands ([dynamic pricing]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/2019-01-01-Dynamic-Pricing.html)), and how to make smarter transceivers ([deep learning]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio/deep-learning/)-based wireless physical layers).
