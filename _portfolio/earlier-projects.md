## Swept-tuned Spectrum Analyzer, National 1st Prize in 2005 National Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest, (4-day contest)
* National 1st prize (Top 3.8%, 173/4470)
* Designed and implemented an automatic spectrum analysis and modulation identification of analog signal under test for frequency range of 0.1--30MHz. 
* A key performance of this spectrum analyzer is that it achieved fine spectral resolution of 200Hz with active crystal narrow band filter. I designed and implemented the analog superheterodyne frontend with dual-channel DDS signal source. 
* Worked with 2 teammates, and 1 advisor.
